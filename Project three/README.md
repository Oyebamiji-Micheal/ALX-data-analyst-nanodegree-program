# Exploration of FIFA World Cup Datasets

This is the third project in ALX-Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. This project requires students to demonstrate the understanding of two important data analysis process: Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis. All information including data sets, data source, insights and observations are included in the notebooks.
## Datasets

The datasets. This project features three datasets downloaded from Kaggle [(Data Source)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abecklas/fifa-world-cup?select=WorldCups.csv). 
The first dataset contains basic match information such as home team name, stadium, city, referee name and so on. 
The second dataset contains player information such as player name, shirt number, position etc. 
The last dataset contains information about the tournament such as the winners, runner-ups, qualified team, goals scored etc.

<font color='red'>**Note: Data for 1950 and 2018 world cup are missing from 'matches_clean_df' table. Gathering the dataset would require significant amount of time. However, though not an excuse, since this project is primarily focused on data visualization, this data is not gathered. In this vein, all questions answered is not and should not be considered 'accurate' as they might be off by few units.**</font>

## Summary of Findings

From the result of my analysis and visualizations, I was able to answer some questions about the datasets. Few of these include:  
>- About 83 countries have participated in the World Cup. Please note that this finding follows the dataset and does not count countries that have now merged as 'one' or split as 'two'. 
>- The top three countries with highest participation are Non-European Countries
>- The 1950 World Cup hosted by Brazil has the highest total number of attendance; over a million!
>- RONALDO has the highest number of match played.
>- While most World Cup games are played in the month of June, majority of finals are played in the month of July and never beyond! This means the tournament does not take up to three months.
>- A higher percentage of participants are European Countries. 
>- Brazil has the highest number of World Cup titles.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on three things: countries, continents and attendance. 
I started by introducing countries with highest appearance, then a set of plots which shows relationship between countries and continents. 
Lastly, I introduced plots with 'attendance' as area of focus
