# Wrangle and Analyze Data 
Project two! I'd say this is a very challenging project for me. This project primarily focuses on data wrangling. The motivation behind is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. Along the project, I queried Twitter API, downloaded files programmatically using python library and finally wrangled three datasets using some Python libraries and Pandas functions. More information on the project can be found in the following files:   
- wrangle_act.ipynb: Project notebook. This is where significant units of energy is expended. All wrangling efforts are channeled in this notebook.
- act_report.html: This file contains all findings and visualizations and are inspired from 'wrangle_act.ipynb'.
- wrangle_report.html: This file contains a detailed summary of wrangling performed in 'wrangle_act.ipynb'.
